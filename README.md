# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This data analysis focuses on the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare the different outcomes for the Parent Category of “Theater” throughout the year as well as comparing the subcategory of “plays” against the Campaign Goal ranges to find out what makes a successful campaign.

### Analysis and Challenges
The Data was sorted and filtered. The initial data was difficult to work with due to not having the appropriate information for dates. The deadline and launch column were converted to Dates. The Category/Subcategory column was split into two columns to better analyze the data for specific Parent Categories and subcategories.
The first analysis was to compare the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date. For this analysis a Pivot table was performed accompanying by a graph.
The second analysis required to compare the different outcomes for the subcategory “plays” under the Parent Category “Theater” against the Goal amount. For this analysis I created a column with range of Goal based on the amount. I added the total of ‘successful’, ‘failed’ and ‘canceled’ campaigns for each goal amount group. I also added the Total campaigns for each Goal group and added the percentage for each ‘successful’, ‘failed’ and ‘canceled’ campaigns on each Goal amount range. Lastly, a line chart was created for Outcomes based on the different Goal-amount ranges. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Using the required filters, I was able to discover that out of 1,369 Theater campaigns, 839 were successful ones with a higher rate of success during May and June. I suggest that running a campaign during the two months previously mentioned would give a higher chance of having a successful campaign. Other months were found to have a good chance of success such as April and August. I would also suggest avoiding the month of October for running a campaign as the number of failed campaigns was close to the total number of successful ones.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using the different Goal-amount ranges, I was able to analyze the total number and percentage of ‘successful’, ‘failed’, and ‘canceled’ campaigns throughout each range. Based on the findings, I suggest setting future campaign Goal amount for ‘plays’ between $1,000 and $4,999 as this range suggests having the most successful campaigns. I also suggest avoiding Goal amount above $15, 000 the higher the Goal amount is the harder it is to predict a successful campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were no challenges for the methods used to test the data. However, I had a hard time finding conclusions.

## Results
1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The conclusion for this analysis is that Theater campaigns have a higher rate of success during the summer season than the winter season. 

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

‘plays’ under Theater are most successful when the Goal-amount is between $1,000 and $4,999. 

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitation with this dataset is that we don’t have additional factors such as the number of attendees or the city where the campaign took place that would have probably made a difference in determining a successful campaign.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other possible table and graphs that we could create would be analyzing the data using different statistical methods to find the mean and median for Theater outcomes based on Launch dates and goal amount.
